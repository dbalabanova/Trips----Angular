# Trips -- Angular


## Idea
An app that stores useful information about trips to different destinations.

### 

There is a public part - Home page - when user is not registered or logged in, when logged in he/she is redirected to the homepage.
If user wants to go to Trips when not logged in- he/she is redirected to login form.
when User is logged in he/she has access to trips list.
Logged in user can:
- create trip
- edit trip
- delete trip
